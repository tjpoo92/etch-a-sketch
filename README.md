# Etch-A-Sketch

This project was to make a page very similar to the idea of a real-life etch-a-sketch, where when a point is drug across a space it would draw whatever a person wanted.

This project had a few improvements from the real-life Etch-A-Sketch:

1. Allow user to change their "point" color
2. Allow the user to clear their space and choose a new workspace size

In this project I am demonstrating the ability to use:

1. Problem Solve
2. Research how to use various JS functions and use variables in CSS
3. Good programming techniques
4. Browser Developer Tools
5. Staying within project scope
6. Use CSS Grid
7. Javascript DOM manipulation
   - To create and append elements in a dynamic way so as the user can change the size of their space
   - To change the color of the "point"
8. Events

Overall, I felt the project went very well. I struggled using CSS Grid for a long time and worked through various tutorials and examples before it clicked. I still don't feel extremely comfortable with it, but I feel like I'm starting to understand the capabilities of it. I also started to get a bit lost in my dreams of things I thought would be interesting to implement in this project and I quickly learned that I was taking more time implementing bells and whistles and not actually completing what the project requested. I also took some time to learn a bit more on markdown to improve my presentation

Things I'd like to work on for future projects:

1. CSS Grid
   - Want to continue to improve. I see the value of using it, I just don't feel comfortable implementing it quickly to my liking
2. Good programming techniques
   - Obvious item, however I feel like I tend to string together code that just works and then go back and fix it up so it's not "spaghetti code"
   - I'd like to be able to do this as I'm working as opposed to after
